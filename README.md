***M Abdus Shakur***

* My passion ignited in childhood, leading me to create cheats for games using C# in 2016. Since then, I've seamlessly transitioned from C++ to Android development with Java, web development with HTML, CSS, and JS, and even ventured into cybersecurity.

* Throughout my high school years (2017-2022), My insatiable curiosity propelled me towards game development with Unity and Unreal Engine,(C#,C++.), backend development with Laravel, SQL, and Node.js for Discord bot dev. And I have done freelance works, honing my skills in C++, C#, desktop applications, web apps, and reverse engineering. 

* In 2023, I took a year-long college hiatus to immerse myself in my passions, exploring AI/ML, Android development with Kotlin, DSA, and even dabbled in competitive programming. My linguistic curiosity also flourished, as I began learning various foreign languages. I utilized this dropout year to the fullest, expanding my skillset and nurturing my love for technology & Mangaka.

* Beyond my technical skills, I’m known for my helpful nature and commitment to truth. I believe in thinking about the betterment of others and standing up for what’s right, even if it means walking alone. I’m always ready to lend a hand and share my knowledge with others.

* Despite the challenges I’ve faced, such as my innovative projects being declined at local science fairs due to a lack of understanding of ict teachers, I remain undeterred. These experiences have only fueled my passion for technology and innovation.

* Currently, I’m particularly interested in backend development and AI/ML. I’m excited to continue learning & growing. Feel free to connect with me for collaboration on projects, knowledge sharing, or a friendly chat about the latest tech trends!
